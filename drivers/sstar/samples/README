Compile these small test program then execute them on target
EX: arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -DPLATFORM_NAME=INFINITY -static -o regio.bin regio.c

Basically one C file should generate one test application

Use the "PLATFORM_NAME" define to check chip difference(CEDRIC, CHICAGO, INFINITY)
Use "uname()" C API in code to check kernel version
Application may need to be recompiled for different PLATFORM_NAME
Application "SHOULD NOT" need to be recompiled for different kernel version

Check the unametest.c, the output is as following:

system name = Linux
node name   = (none)
release     = 3.18.14
version     = #421 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jun 11 07:05:52 CST 2015
machine     = armv7l


ajtc.c        network socket test client, packet generator
ajts.c        network socket test server, packet receiver
us_ticks.c    check the wrapping of IOCTL_MSYS_GET_US_TICKS
regio.c       userspace register w/r sample
dmem.c        userspace DMEM allocation & w/r sample
