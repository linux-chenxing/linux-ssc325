< WT_POWERUP >
SD Spec:
- This delay should be sufficient to allow the power supply to reach the minimum voltage.
HW measure:
- About 5x us is enough.

< WT_POWERON >
SD Spec:
- This delay must be at least 74 clock sizes, or 1 ms, or the time required to reach a stable voltage.

< WT_POWEROFF >
SD Spec:
- the card VDD shall be once lowered to less than 0.5Volt for a minimum period of 1ms.
HW measure:
- SD_3V3 has 2K resistance to gnd: 30 ms.
- SD_3V3 does Not have any resistance to gnd: 1500 ms.
